# CS300-DSA-Analysis-and-Design


This C++ program is a basic implementation of a Binary Search Tree for managing course information. It allows users to load course data from a CSV file, display the course list, search for specific courses by ID, and view their details. The program uses a straightforward structure, including a Binary Search Tree class, Node structure, and a CSV parser library (CSVparser.hpp) for handling data. Users can compile and run the program, providing optional command-line arguments for the CSV file path and a course ID to search for.
